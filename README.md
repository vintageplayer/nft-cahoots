# jointNFT-polygon-hack

A marketplace for NFT funds. Investors invest money into any number of funds. Funds can be managed by NFT Curators or community. Investors participate with experts with shared risk. Curators get to earn a cut from the profit, and invest in more assets.

# Current Standing:

As of the current project, the concept of the NFT cahoot has the following features.

Investors can: 
- View the different cahoots that are present in the marketplace.
- Invest into a cahoots and get erc20 cahoots tokens. 
- Sell their cahoots tokens back to the cahoots. 
- View all the NFT's that are present in the cahoots. 

Cahoots Managers can:
- Create a cahoots by depositing a certain amount of MATIC themselfs.
- Use the cahoots to buy NFT's from opensea as a simulated trade.
- Sell NFT's from the cahoots in a simulated fashion

Future scope: 
- The investors will be able to see the history of the cahoots. 
- Will be able to buy NFT's from the cahoots directly , thus making it a NFT marketplace in itself.
- Create DAO's
- A centralised wallet management service will need to be built to work with the existing marketplaces to buy and sell NFT's.
- Cahoot managers will be able to block buying and selling of tokens from the cahoots. 
- Build a cross chain platform in such a way that it can buy and sell NFT's from other chains. Ex; ethereum.
